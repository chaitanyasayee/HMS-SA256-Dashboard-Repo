# Hospital Management System

The Hospital Management System is a software solution designed to automate and improve various aspects of hospital administration. It aims to replace manual, paper-based systems and streamline hospital tasks. The system securely stores patient data with cardiovascular disease using the SHA-256 technique, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. The project focuses on modeling the effectiveness of predicting mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease.

## Motivation
The motivation behind developing the Hospital Management System is to bring numerous benefits to healthcare organizations. By implementing this system, hospitals can enhance patient care through efficient management of medical records and treatment plans. It saves time and reduces errors, allowing healthcare professionals to concentrate on delivering exceptional care. The system is designed to meet evolving industry demands and provide the highest standard of healthcare management.

## Scope
The scope of the Hospital Management System includes providing a comprehensive solution to automate and improve various hospital administration tasks. It enables doctors to prescribe medications, lab tests, and treatments based on patients' symptoms and health conditions. Nurses can access these prescriptions to perform the necessary services efficiently. The system aims to revolutionize healthcare operations and improve patient care by providing well-organized, cost-effective solutions that reduce the time and resources required for these tasks.
